# USDS Engineering Take-Home Assessment

## Purpose

The United States Federal Government has over 200,000 pages of federal regulations across ~150 main agencies, all of which can be found within the eCFR at [https://www.ecfr.gov/](https://www.ecfr.gov/). There is a public API for it.

The goal of this assessment is to create a simple website to analyze Federal Regulations to allow for more digestible and actionable insights to be made on potential deregulation efforts across the government.
